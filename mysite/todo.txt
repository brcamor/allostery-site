How to test javascript?

Add line to d3 graphs for 95, 97.5, 99 quartiles calculated from test set

Order residues by int rather than string

Move jquery into script file?
     - may need to use JSON to dump data into template and then call javascript function on this object	
     - see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1445989/passing-python-data-to-javascript-via-django?rq=1 

Data model?

Improve styling
	- home page figure
	- banner 
	- home button
	- header
	- design results page

Work out how to color residues by pp in Jmol

Quantile scores

Add box below jsmol applets to allow manipulation with jmol commands

Retrive name and drop down on home (search) page 

Extra page between selecting source residues and running analysis?
      - summarise included chains/hetatms and chosen source residues
      - allow to choose some option for the analysis e.g. quantile scores/transients/edge-edge

Graceful failure:
	 - "try"
	 - deal with not finding HETATM in the database by removing that atom

Refactor d3.js graph scripts into single function

Better way to check if chains/hetatms/source pages already visited

Refactor setup info into setup_params class?

Work out how to download results files


Transients analysis
