Biological unit!
Quantile scores
Improve source residue selection page - drop downs and 'add' button? (AJAX to avoid page refresh)

Work out how to color residues by pp in Jmol
Work out how to show residues in jmol when you click on residue in results graph

Extra page between selecting source residues and running analysis?
      - summarise included chains/hetatms and chosen source residues
      - allow to choose some option for the analysis e.g. quantile scores/transients/edge-edge

Refactor d3.js graph scripts into single function

Graceful failure:
	 - "try"
	 - deal with not finding HETATM in the database by removing that atom

Better way to check if chains/hetatms/source pages already visited

Refactor setup info into setup_params class?

Work out how to download results files

Refactor tests (unit and functional) to be more DRY
