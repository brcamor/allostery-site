Order residues by int rather than string

Improve source residue selection page - drop downs and 'add' button? (AJAX to avoid page refresh)

Improve styling
	- background
	- banner 
	- home button
	- header
	- design results page

Work out how to color residues by pp in Jmol

Biological unit!
Quantile scores

Add box below jsmol applets to allow manipulation with jmol commands

Retrive name and drop down on home (search) page 

Extra page between selecting source residues and running analysis?
      - summarise included chains/hetatms and chosen source residues
      - allow to choose some option for the analysis e.g. quantile scores/transients/edge-edge

Graceful failure:
	 - "try"
	 - deal with not finding HETATM in the database by removing that atom

Refactor d3.js graph scripts into single function

Better way to check if chains/hetatms/source pages already visited

Refactor setup info into setup_params class?

Work out how to download results files

Refactor tests (unit and functional) to be more DRY
