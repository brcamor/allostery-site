Extra page between selecting source residues and running analysis?
      - summarise included chains/hetatms and chosen source residues
      - allow to choose some option for the analysis e.g. quantile scores/transients/edge-edge

Django seems to save tuples as lists - is there a more elegant way of dealing with this than 
just converting back?

Calculate quantile regression scores

Biological unit!

Better way to check if chains/hetatms/source already visited

Refactor setup info into setup_params class?

Improve source residue selection page - drop downs and 'add' button? (AJAX to avoid page refresh)
Add residue name

Embed jmol in source residues page to highlight selected residues 

Embed jmol in results page to show results

Work out how to download results files

Refactor tests (unit and functional) to be more DRY
