Extra page between selecting source residues and running analysis?
      - summarise included chains/hetatms and chosen source residues
      - allow to choose some option for the analysis e.g. quantile scores/transients/edge-edge

Show residue graph:
     - calculate residue distance
     - make csv file with data in

Graceful failure:
	 - "try"

Deal with not finding HETATM in the database by removing that atom

Class for "run": data and methods for analysing that data

Calculate quantile regression scores

Biological unit!

Better way to check if chains/hetatms/source already visited

Refactor setup info into setup_params class?

Improve source residue selection page - drop downs and 'add' button? (AJAX to avoid page refresh)
Add residue name

Embed jmol in source residues page to highlight selected residues 

Embed jmol in results page to show results

Work out how to download results files

Refactor tests (unit and functional) to be more DRY
